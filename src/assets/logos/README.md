# Company Logos

This folder contains the logo images for companies displayed in the "Companies i've done design for" section on the About page.

## How to Add Logos

**Simply add your logo files to this folder!** The logos will be automatically discovered and displayed in the grid - no code changes needed.

### Supported Formats

- PNG (recommended for logos with transparency)
- SVG (vector format, scales perfectly)
- JPG/JPEG
- WebP

### Naming

You can name your logos however you like. They will be automatically sorted alphabetically by filename.

**Examples:**
- `telia.png`
- `company-name.svg`
- `logo-1.png`, `logo-2.png`, etc.
- Any naming convention you prefer!

### Notes

- All logos will be automatically resized and centered within the grid
- The component uses `object-contain` to preserve aspect ratios
- Logos are displayed on a dark background (`bg-surface-secondary`)
- Add or remove logos anytime - they'll automatically appear/disappear from the page
